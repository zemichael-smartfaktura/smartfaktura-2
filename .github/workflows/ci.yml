# CI runs on every PR and every push (any branch). Paths filter uses "files in this push/PR" so only touched app builds.
# Render: linked to main only, deploy on commit; buildFilter limits deploys to backend/shared-types changes.
# Vercel: branch previews for PRs; production from main. Root Directory apps/frontend, skip when no changes.
